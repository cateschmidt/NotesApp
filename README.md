# NotesApp

This app is a notes app that allows the user to take notes as they desire. The user can create notes, edit notes, and delete notes that they create. It uses SQLite and the C# language to accomplish this. 

My purpose for writing this software is to provide a simple and user friendly notes app that people can use for their studies, work, or personal life.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I would like to work on the front end design in the future to make it more attractive.
- I would like to make some login functionality so the users will have to login, and once logged in they can only view certain notes.
- I would also like to make the notes more attractive, so work on the front end design of the notes.
